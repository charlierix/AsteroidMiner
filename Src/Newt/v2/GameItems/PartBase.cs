        BrainPlugin,		// this one wouldn't be used in a pure evolution simulation.  Instead, this should be thought of as something like an OR, AND, NAND gate.  It is a brain that was trained by some external utility to recognize certain patterns.  It would have a small set of output neurons placed far away from the working neurons (like 6 neurons in a pentagon plate, always off the X axis - or something like that).  Instead of the external links simply hooking to whatever is at some point, it should request specific parts to hook to (ex: give me a camera and a force sensor, regardless of location, ignore all other parts).  This way, a random ship could be assembled, then download some plugin brains trained for what you want, and wire it up.
        BrainScripted,		// this would have similar interface as BrainPlugin (ask for certain parts, have well defined outputs, or even ask for a set of parts to directly control), but instead of internally being a neural net, it would run a bit of custom code (like javascript).  That would give the user a chance to write their own AI logic.  (ex: when plugin brain detects food, and cargo < X, fire neurons.  etc).  This wouldn't do much good controlling thrusters/guns, but it could be used to trigger anxiety (or concepts like that).  Or if controlling other parts, could be used to directly raise shields, jetison cargo, put parts on standby (and if manipulating BrainRadio, alerting others)

        // Equipment
        ThrustController,		// thrusters expose a neuron that will directly control that particular thruster.  This should expose a spherical shell of input neurons that represents a desired vector.  This will translate that vector into the set of thrusters needed to make the ship go in that direction without introducing spin
        ProjectileGun,		// fires projectiles (could be simple slugs, or missiles, or drones).  It will need an ammo tank that only it can use
        BeamGun,		// probably keep this short range, more like a laser sword, or flame thrower

        VibroSpike,		// very good for ramming, consumes small amounts of energy

        //to independently have its own set of Visual3Ds and keep their transforms up to date (use the map class to manage calling the camera pool
