I'm sharing this with the public because even if you don't care about the alife simulator, you may find some of the code useful in your own projects.

This is written in C#, and uses WPF.  The physics engine is an open source dll called Newton Dynamics.

The physics engine has an open source zlib licence, so I'm doing the same for this app.  But personally, I don't care if people copy bits of my code for their own use, that's why I'm sharing this publicly.";

@"The goal for this app is to be an artificial life simulation.  At first, it will be space with asteroids and minerals, but eventually there will be fluid and planets.  So you could have flyers, swimmers, crawlers all in the same map.

The bots will start off as randomly generated with random neural net brains, or they could be created with the editor.  The designs that are able to survive their environment will be able to breed or reproduce asexually.

I also want the human player to have the option to play along side the bots, harvesting minerals or other bots.  They should be able to upgrade their ship, or create a new one, whatever.  The goal isn't to be an in depth video game, just a fun way to interact with an artificial life simulation.

The user could also just choose to run the simulation without having their own ship.  They should be able to manipulate the environment: import/clone/delete/modify/move bots or other game objects, tweek map settings, etc.

Most of the settings for the workings of a bot are defined by the map.  The bot's shape is defined for that bot, but the density of all the parts, energy draw, etc are defined by the map.  This way, you could make thrusters expensive, and tractor beams cheap, then sit back to see what emerges.

The defintion of a map will also hold size, vector fields, radiation, gravity, asteroids, planets, stars, etc.

The idea is that the bots will evolve to be optimal for the map they are in.  A robust bot could be cloned across many maps and still thrive.";

The Game.HelperClassesWPF project has quite a bit in there.  It is a combination of other people's code and mine:
	- Extenders has some handy extension methods (Vector.ToPoint() and Point.ToVector() should ship native, they make life a lot easier)
	- Math3D has a lot in it
	- UtilityWPF has a bunch of color stuff, as well as a bunch of 3D geometry builders (cube, sphere, etc)
	- StaticRandom is a singleton that creates one random class per request thread
	- Triangle is a good triangle primitive (ITriangle, and two implementations of that)
	- Trackball is reworked from the codeplex 3D tools Trackball, it has an easy way to set up mappings
	- ScreenSpaceLines3D is also from codeplex 3D tools, it is very useful to draw lines in 3D

Game.Newt.v2.NewtonDynamics is a C# wrapper to the newton dll.  Newton is a great engine, I have a feeling a lot of the downloads will just be for this.";

      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,

      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each

      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
